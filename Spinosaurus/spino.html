        <p>For many decades, scientists pictured Spinosaurus as a land-dwelling dinosaur with long back legs, similar to dinosaurs like Tyrannosaurus and Allosaurus.<br>
        However, new discoveries show that it actually had much shorter legs and probably spent a lot of time in or near the water. Its tail was also broad and shaped like a paddle.
        Researchers still aren't sure if Spinosaurus was an active swimmer or if it mainly stayed along the water's edge.
